			<br>
			<p>i have noticed this debate that humans sometimes tend to have, where they will talk about having internal monologues and whatnot. they say that someone without one of these so-called "monologues" is stupid, or that they do not think, or that they are empty-headed... things like that. however, every time it comes up around me, i always think: "isn't it the opposite? are <i>you</i> not the one on autopilot, being told what to do all the time, not in control of what you're thinking as you're thinking it?" it is not as if someone without a voice in their head cannot think at all, right?</p>
			<br>
			<p>anyway.. we know how these things work, how little it matters. i bring it up because i have this related problem of... like, a blur? just this near-constant blur. walking-along-the-road-and-forgetting-where-i-am kind of blur. i can't think, not about the numbness, not about the <i>excessive</i> empty-headed feelings. and i can never describe it properly... even this writing does not do it justice, because it constantly wanes back and forth; in and out, just replaying the most intense episodes of halo-pulsing bullshit-wrenching un-addressable torture porn in my head, over and over, on and off. in the interim, the times where things are okay, it is almost easy to forget that it is even there, until it strikes back and i collapse down into a puddle of nothing for even longer. and, like... it has been like this for years. for maybe as long as i can remember? and love helps, it helps immensely, but then when <i>that</i> collapses too, it just cycles into some kind of super-tornado of pain, and dissipates, comes back not long after, and on, and on, and on. and all i can think is "wow! maybe i don't deserve to be okay, or deserve anything at all? love especially? maybe all that empty guilt i feel is there for a reason? is this really all that there is? THIS? why am i even here? why is it so much easier for everyone else around me? i'm not good enough. i can't be as good as them. why bother? sorry! sorry. sorry. i should not have said anything. sorry. sorry.. sorry. sorry for not being good enough. sorry. sorry for existing. sorry..." its as if i cannot even LET myself think about it, else risk allowing The Listeners to hear. </p>
			<br> 
			<p>like... the complete opposite of humans and their monologues. their internal voices, telling them how awful they are. but it's just.. always fucking there for me. and i <i>can't</i> think about it. i'm not allowed. there's a block. there's the disjumbled.. blur. i can't even remember anything anymore, on top of it. so it is all just.. one big mess.</p> 
			<br> 
			<p>i don't know. does anyone else have this? its like... these in-between months, where i can do things freely, where i can try to be "normal", that's all i've got. but there is no "normal". so its just. Fuck! you know? Fuck. lately i find myself just muting thoughts about it as much as i can and getting sucked into shit to ignore it. sometimes i feel sick when i think about it because i know how bad these thought-lines can be, but i can't really do anything about it. its really obviously unhealthy and hurts me a lot. just... sucks. does anyone else have similar issues?</p>
