I was there when they designed that barn, and there when they left, too - the security was so on the nose that no one ever figured out what it was for years. Not even their <em>actual government investigators</em>. Not until 2010 (their UTC, not ATC) when a group of explorers broke in and triggered Cassiel. You should have seen the footage! I'm smiling just thinking about it bahhaha",

And that building is a school now? Something like that. Every once in a while someone takes a look but I wouldn't know 100%",
