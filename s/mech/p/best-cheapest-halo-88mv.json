Listening to signals and having background music is nice, not too heavy, (good) ones are easy to tune mentally, and there isn't a lot of demand so there are plenty available for pretty cheap.",

That's how you get people with LED strips and stuff. So if you can just find a small line of christmas lights and wrap them around it then it works reeally well and is super cute. As far as spikes go, there are definitely some you can grab in some places that just wrap on, you just hafta look around",
